# Results

### Generalized additive models

The GAM including all covariates (Eq. \@ref(eq:gam5)) had the lowest AIC and explained most of the variability in the observed weights (**Table \@ref(tab:GAMsAICTable)**). The total deviance explained was `r round(summary(GAM5)$dev.expl*100, 1)`%.  Results showed that the relationship between fork length and round weight varies with sex, space, and time while the fleet and fishery have also an effect on morphometric parameters of Indian Ocean albacore (_p_-value< 0.001). The relationship shows some seasonal variations with the highest values of weight estimated in February-March and the lowest values in August (**Fig. \@ref(fig:GAMMonthEffect)**). The interaction between fork length and sex indicates that the relationship differs between males and females (**Fig. \@ref(fig:GAMFLSexEffect)**). Habitat explains some variability in the relationship, with increased weight at higher latitudes and some variability along the coasts of the Indian Ocean (**Fig. \@ref(fig:GAMLongLatSexEffect)**).

### Linear models

The linear model including all covariates except fishery had the lowest AIC. All effects kept in the model were found to be highly statistically significant. However, each of them explained a small percentage of total variation as compared to fork length. After accounting for length, the most important effect explaining weight was the area of origin of the fish (**Table \@ref(tab:AnovaTableLM)**). The relationship was also found to vary with sex, with males having smaller weights than females.

## Statistical models

We used mean linear regression models to examine the relationships between FL and RD after log-transformation of the data. First, we included the following categorical covariates to assess their influence on the relationship: gender (_Sex_), stock assessment area (_Area_), fishery group (_FisheryGroup_), and quarter of capture (_Quarter_) used as a proxy of season. The full model fitted to the morphometric data was:

$$\log_{10}(RD_i) = \log_{10}(FL_i) + Sex + Area + FisheyGroup + Quarter + \epsilon_{i}$$
The model residuals $\epsilon_{i}$ were assumed to be independent and identically distributed normal random variables with mean zero and constant variance. We log10-transformed the variables to represent the assumption that measurement errors in weights are multiplicative. Predictions of the parameters accounted for bias due to log10-transformation [@Smith1993]. Assumptions of homoscedasticity and Gaussian distribution were checked through the residuals. Models were evaluated using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.1.0 (R Core Team, 2022).

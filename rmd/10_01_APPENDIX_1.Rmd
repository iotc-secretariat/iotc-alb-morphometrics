## Linear models

### Best selected model with all covariates except fishery

```{r DiagnosticLMALL, fig.cap = "Diagnostic of the best selected linear regression model of round weights including all covariates (Eq. 6) except fishery as selected from the lowest AIC"}
include_graphics("../outputs/charts/LMS/ALB_FL_RD_ALL_FINAL_DIAGNOSTIC.png")
```

### Model with fork length and area

```{r DiagnosticLMFLArea, fig.cap = "Diagnostic of the linear regression model of round weights of Indian Ocean albacore including only fork length (log10 transformed) and area as covariates"}
include_graphics("../outputs/charts/LMS/ALB_FL_RD_AREA_LM_DIAGNOSTIC.png")
```

### Model with fork length

```{r DiagnosticLMOnlyFL, fig.cap = "Diagnostic of the linear regression model of round weights of Indian Ocean albacore only including fork length (log10 transformed) as covariate"}
include_graphics("../outputs/charts/LMS/ALB_FL_RD_UNIVARIATE_LM_DIAGNOSTIC.png")

# Introduction

Morphometric relationships and conversion factors are instrumental in fisheries science to harmonize size-frequency data and compute weight from length to derive raising factors for extrapolation, estimate the species composition of the catch from size samples, and compute reporting coverage for catches reported in numbers. Several length-length and length-weight relationships have been estimated for Indian Ocean albacore (_Thunnus alalunga_) based on morphometric data collected through different fisheries monitoring programs and research projects [@Hsu1999;@IOTC2005;@Setyadji2012;@Geehan2013;@Dhurmeea2016;@Bodin2018;@Bonhommeau2019]. The current IOTC official relationship between fork length (FL) and round weight (RD) has however been derived for albacore caught in the southeast Atlantic Ocean [@Penney1994]. In this context, the overarching objective of the study was to develop a statistical relationship between fork length and round weight for albacore based on the collation of different data sources available from a range of fisheries catching albacore across the whole Indian Ocean.

<!-- First, factors affecting the variability in weight measurements were assessed using generalized additive models (GAMs). Second, a mean regression model accounting for the main  was developed to XX. Third, the influence of the new relationship on the standardized size-frequency data set was assessed against the current version .  -->

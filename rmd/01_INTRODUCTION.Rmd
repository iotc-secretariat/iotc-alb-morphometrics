# Introduction

Morphometric relationships and conversion factors are instrumental in fisheries science to harmonize size-frequency data and compute weight from length so as to derive raising factors for extrapolation, estimate the species composition of the catch from size-frequency samples, and compute reporting coverage for catches reported in numbers. Several length-length and length-weight relationships have been estimated for Indian Ocean albacore (_Thunnus alalunga_) based on morphometric data collected through different fisheries monitoring programs and research projects [@Hsu1999;@IOTC2005;@Setyadji2012;@Geehan2013;@Dhurmeea2016;@Bodin2018;@Bonhommeau2019]. The current IOTC official relationship between fork length (FL) and round weight (RD) has however been derived for albacore caught in the southeast Atlantic Ocean [@Penney1994]. In this context, the overarching objective of the study was to develop a statistical relationship between fork length and round weight for albacore based on the collation of different data sources available from a range of fisheries catching albacore across the whole Indian Ocean. First, we assessed the factors affecting the variability in weight measurements with generalized additive models [@Hastie1990]. Second, we fitted mean regression models to the data and assessed the influence of spatio-temporal factors, sex, and type of fishery on the weights solely predicted from fish length. Third, we developed a new univariate relationship between fork length and round weight for Indian Ocean albacore and estimated its impact on the average weight of albacore in the catch for the strata sampled for size.

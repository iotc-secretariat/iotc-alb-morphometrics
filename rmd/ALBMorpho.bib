Four different fitting algorithms were used. The four resultant formulae were not significantly different. However, the formula W=0.056907FL2.7514, where W is the body weight in g and FL is the fork length in cm, estimated by least square of residuals excluding suspected outliers which were diagnosed by least median square of residuals, is considered as an acceptable and useful one. Consequently, the equation can be used to compile catch databases mainly from the surface gears and for other assessment purposes.},

In the Indian Ocean, while tuna species are relatively well described, there is a critical lack of information for billfish and the interannual and seasonal variations of these relationships are rarely investigated. To cope with this issue, the relationships used at IOTC are coming from other oceans or close species which is not scientifically satisfactory. In this document, we present the biometric relationships for 6 large pelagic species over 267 individuals in 2017 and 2018 from catches of Reunionese longliners. The classical length and weights are established for this species. While the relationships are very neat, further collections are needed to provide robust relationship. This document question our ability to share and build a global biological database at IOTC which can be regularly updated and provided the best scientific knowledge for these relationship.

  abstract  = {Tuna are marine apex predators that inhabit the tropical and sub-tropical waters of the Indian Ocean where they support socially and economically important fisheries. Key component of pelagic communities, tuna are bioindicator species of anthropogenic and climate-induced changes through modifications of the structure and related energy-flow of food webs and ecosystems. The IndianEcoTuna dataset provides a panel of ecological tracers measured in four soft tissues (white muscle, red muscle, liver, gonads) from 1,364 individuals of four species, i.e., the albacore (ALB, Thunnus alalunga), the bigeye (BET, T.-obesus), the skipjack (SKJ, Katsuwomus pelamis), and the yellowfin (YFT, T.-albacares), collected throughout the western Indian Ocean from 2009 to 2015. Sampling was carried out during routine monitoring programs, at sea by observers onboard professional vessels or at landing. For each record, the type of fishing gear, the conservation mode, as well as the fishing date and catch location are provided. Individuals were sampled to span a wide range of body sizes: 565 ALB with fork length from 58 to 118-cm, 155 BET from 29.5 to 173-cm, 304 SKJ from 30 to 74-cm, and 340 YFT from 29 to 171.5-cm. The IndianEcoTuna dataset combines: (1) 9,512 records of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (percent element weights, -13C and -15N values) in 1,185 fish, (2) 887 concentrations of total proteins in 242 fish, (3) 8,356 concentrations of total lipids and three lipid classes (triacylglycerols TAG; phospholipids PL; sterols ST) in 695 fish, and (4) 1,150 and 1,033 profiles of neutral and polar fatty acids in 397 and 342 fish, respectively. Information on sex and weights of the whole fish, gonads, liver and stomach is provided. Because of the essential trophic role and wide-ranging of tuna in marine systems, and the large panel of tropho-energetic tracers and derived-key quantitative parameters provided (e.g., niche width, trophic position, condition indices), the IndianEcoTuna dataset should be of high interest for global and regional research on marine trophic ecology and food web analysis, as well as on the impacts of anthropogenic changes on Indian Ocean marine ecosystems.

  abstract = {It has been known for some time (DJ Finney, J. Roy. Stat. Soc. Suppl. 7:155–161, 1941) that transformation of an arithmetic data set to logarithms results in biased estimates when predicted values from a leastsquares regression are detransformed back to arithmetic units. Predicted values are estimates of the geometric mean of the dependent variable at that value of the independent variable, rather than the arithmetic mean. Since the geometric mean is always less than the arithmetic mean, detransformed predictions will underestimate the value in question. This bias affects the interpretations of allometric equations used for estimation, such as predicting fossil body mass from skeletal dimensions, and applications of allometry as a “criterion of subtraction,” in which residual variation is evaluated. A number of parametric and nonparametric corrections for transformation bias have been developed. Although this problem is relatively unexplored in mammalian morphometrics, it has received considerable attention in other disciplines that use power functions structurally identical to the allometric equation. Insights into transformation bias and the use of correction terms from economics, limnology, forestry, and hydrology are reviewed and interpreted for application to mammalian allometry. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract  = {Summary. Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton–Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

  abstract = {Establishing appropriate aging procedures and growth models are two important steps for estimating reliable growth curves and in developing proper stock assessments. Lizardfishes have a strong influence on the structures of epibenthic communities and are important to the trawl fisheries of many coastal countries. For brushtooth lizardfish, Saurida undosquamis, the major species in the lizardfish catches of Taiwan, three issues were investigated. First, we used generalized additive models to explore factors (e.g., sex, data source, season) affecting the length-weight relationship (LWR), and to estimate suitable parameters. Second, we identified suitable procedures for otolith preparation (sagittal or transverse sections), validated the periodicity of ring increments using marginal increment analysis (MIA) with discussions of the appropriateness of the analysis, and determined the “best-fit” growth model via multi-model inference. Lastly, we compared growth estimates from this study with those published globally and developed an overview of global variation and the main associated variables through hierarchical cluster analysis and random forest modeling. Results suggested the following. (1) A suitable LWR for the stock was BW = 6.269 × 10-3 · FL3.144 for females and BW = 6.439 × 10-3 · FL3.144 for males. The allometric coefficient varied among samples and data sources and through the season. (2) Aging precision may be higher using transverse sections rather than sagittal sections. MIA indicates that otolith ring marks are formed annually during the active spawning season at the end of winter and the beginning of spring (from February). The Von Bertalanffy Growth Model was selected and the parameters (L∞, K, and t0) were: 46.4 cm, 0.12 year-1, and -2.12 year for sex-combined; 38.6 cm, 0.15 year-1, -2.06 year for males; and, 42.0 cm, 0.16 year-1, -1.53 year for females. (3) Globally, 86 sets of growth parameters were compiled from the literature. Region and aging material were the most important sources of variation in global estimates, which indicates the importance of using reliable aging material.},

# Materials & Methods

Albacore morphometric data were collated from different sources and harmonized according to a common standardized format (**Table \@ref(tab:DataFieldsDefinitions)**). The original data sets were collected as part of (i) historical longline observer programs from Korea and the UK [@IOTC2005;@Geehan2013], (ii) national scientific observer programs conducted by CPCs having submitted machine-readable data to the Secretariat as part of the IOTC Regional Observer Scheme (ROS), (iii) research projects conducted on albacore by the University of Mauritius and the French national Research Institute for Sustainable Development [@Dhurmeea2016;@Bodin2018], and (iv) routine monitoring program on the biology of large pelagics conducted by the French national research institute Ifremer in Reunion Island [@Bonhommeau2018;@Bonhommeau2019].

The total data set is comprised of `r prettyNum(ALB_FL_RD[, .N], big.mark = ",")` albacore caught between `r min(ALB_FL_RD$YEAR, na.rm = TRUE)` and `r max(ALB_FL_RD$YEAR, na.rm = TRUE)` from longline, baitboat, line, and purse seine fisheries (**Table \@ref(tab:SamplingDesignTableSourceFisheryGroup)**). The sampling design is unbalanced with most of the data having been collected by scientific observers deployed on commercial deep-freezing longliners that contribute to `r round(ALB_FL_RD[SOURCE %in% c("IOTC ROS", "IOTC HISTORICAL"), .N] / ALB_FL_RD[, .N] * 100, 1)`% of the total data set. Samples from  fresh fish caught by Japanese longliners represent the very large majority of the observer data set available for the study and are made up of measurements of fork length taken to the nearest 0.1 cm with tape, caliper and/or measuring board and round weights mostly taken with 150 kg platform scales and beam scales and reported to the nearest 0.1 kg (_pers. com._ T. Nishida). Other observer samples (n = `r ALB_FL_RD[SAMPLING_PLATFORM == "Onboard" & FLEET_CODE != "JPN", .N]`) were collected onboard deep-freezing longliners from different flags having operated in the Chagos archipelago between `r ALB_FL_RD[SOURCE == "IOTC HISTORICAL", min(YEAR)]` and `r ALB_FL_RD[SOURCE == "IOTC HISTORICAL", max(YEAR)]` with little information available on the sampling protocols.

Other morphometric measurements for albacore caught in purse seine, longline, and baitboat fisheries (n = `r prettyNum(ALB_FL_RD[!SOURCE %in% c("IOTC HISTORICAL", "IOTC ROS") & FISHERY_GROUP_CODE != "LI", .N], big.mark = ",")`) were collected in processing factories located in Victoria (Seychelles), Le Port (La RÃ©union), Port Louis (Mauritius), and Cape Town (South Africa) as part of monitoring and research projects conducted in the region between `r ALB_FL_RD[!SOURCE %in% c("IOTC HISTORICAL", "IOTC ROS"), min(YEAR)]` and `r ALB_FL_RD[!SOURCE %in% c("IOTC HISTORICAL", "IOTC ROS"), max(YEAR)]` [@Chassot2014;@Bodin2018;@Dhurmeea2016;@Bonhommeau2018]. In addition, some samples (n = `r ALB_FL_RD[FISHERY_CODE %in% c("LIH", "LIT"), .N]`) were directly collected in the field for fish caught in coastal handline and trolling fisheries and landed in some local markets of Mauritius [@Dhurmeea2016].

## Conclusions

- Major interest to collate and manage the morphometric data at the Secretariat:
    + To increase sample size and coverage
    + To identify gaps and future sampling
    + To archive and disseminate the information
- More than 12,000 samples available for the fork length - round weight relationship
- More than 9,000 samples reported from Japanese longliners where the length code is unknown
- Apparent effects of area, gear, and/or sex
- Lack of samples in the main fishing grounds: Call for observer data from fleets of Taiwan,China and China mainland
- Collaborative work with a github repository set up: Who wants to contribute?
